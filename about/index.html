    </header>

    <p>
I design, build, maintain, deploy, and manage distributed systems while transforming teams to be more effective through individual growth, technical leadership, re-organization, and streamlining processes.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
how I might be able to help your Engineering organization live up to their highest potential;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how I could streamline your delivery workflow and also improve quality;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how I can grow an engineering mindset that allows engineers to take on projects of greater complexity without adding risk;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how I would improve productivity by optimizing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a>;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how you could use algebraic properties to test-infect our distributed systems;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how I have used functional programming techniques to configure infrastructure more consistently leading to reduced downtime;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how I have led teams building type-safe software that reduced long-term maintenance costs
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Current general purpose languages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Haskell
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
JavaScript/TypeScript
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
PureScript
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ruby
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Current configuration langauges:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Dhall
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Nix
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Current interests include practical use of formal methods for verification and risk management in software delivery, congruent configuration management (e.g. NixOS), and declarative infrastructure.
