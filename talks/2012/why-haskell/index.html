Abstract
</h3>
<p>
Monads, also known as Kleisli triples in Category Theory, are an
(endo-)functor together with two natural transformations, which are
surprisingly useful in pure languages like Haskell, but this talk will
NOT reference monads. Ever. (Well, at least not in this talk.)
</p>
<p>
Instead what I intend to impress upon an audience of newcomers to
Haskell is the wide array of freely available libraries most of which
is liberally licensed open source software, intuitive package
management, practical build tools, reasonable documentation (when you
know how to read it and where to find it), interactive shell (or
REPL), mature compiler, stable runtime, testing tools that will blow
your mind away, and a small but collaborative and knowledgeable
community of developers. Oh, and some special features of Haskell -
the language - too!
