Dynamically scaling a political news and activism hub (up to 5x the traffic in 20 minutes)
</h4>
<p>
C-U Cloud Meetup / April 2019 - Champaign, IL
</p>
<h5 id="headline-6">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
On any given day we can receive traffic peaks up to five times
our base traffic, sometimes requiring us to scale out to double our
backend app server capacity within a 10-20 minutes window (sometimes
at unpredictable times). In this talk, Susan Potter will discuss
our use of autoscaling in EC2 from the essential components to
some gotchas learned along the way.

Functional Operations (Functional Programming at Comcast Labs Connect)
</h4>
<p>
Functional Programming at Comcast Labs Connect / March 2018 - Philadelphia, PA
</p>
<h5 id="headline-10">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
Maintaining configurations for different kinds of nodes and cloud resources in a [micro]service architecture can be an operational nightmare, especially if not managed with the application codebase. CI and CD job environments diverge from production configuration yielding their results unpredictable at best or produce false positives in the worst case. Code pushes to staging and production can have unintended consequences that can&#39;t be reasoned about before deploy and often canâ€™t be inspected thoroughly on a dry run. Leading to unhappy users when problems do arise.
</p>
<p>
This session will demonstrate the use of the Nix and NixOS ecosystem to define and build packages in a referentially transparent way which can be leveraged as a solid foundation to configure systems and test multiple [virtual] machines with coordinated scenarios. We also look at how reliable packaging allows us to build a consistent CI/CD pipeline where upgrading your version of the JVM doesn&#39;t break your CI build servers for days.

Functional and Reactive Operations
</h4>
<p>
Reactive Summit / October 2016 - Austin, TX
</p>
<h5 id="headline-14">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
When we start greenfield development of a new service or web
application today we&#39;d likely employ a number of practices and design
choices that are known to optimise application responsiveness,
resiliency, elasticity, and/or composability. Delivering our reactive
applications on top of predictable infrastructure will set our project
up for success.
</p>
<p>
Some of us don&#39;t have that luxury. We must provision, deploy, and
operationally maintain legacy monolithic Rails web applications and
HTTP APIs that are hard to refactor without introducing new bugs,
poorly performing, and struggle to meet user load/peak demand. Built
during a prior era of the company where fast and loose practices were
rewarded, startup cowboys delivered the first set of features promptly
at the expense of subsequent velocity, long-term maintainability, and
high risk deployments. When living in this reality, our infrastructure
must be reliable or our application needs constant babysitting,
leading to on-call fatigue and high staff turnover.
</p>
<p>
The good news is there are core principles we can apply to produce
more reproducible systems, failstop deployments, and consistent
environment configurations to eliminate a large class of bugs inherent
in legacy applications and minimize related business risks. This will
be the focus of the session and applies to both greenfield and legacy cases.
</p>
<p>
Code examples given using NixOS and Haskell, but focus remains on the
underlying principles.

From Zero To Production (NixOS, Erlang)
</h4>
<p>
Erlang Factory SF 2016 / March 2016 - San Francisco, CA
</p>
<h5 id="headline-20">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
This talk will introduce the audience to the Nix packaging, NixOS, and
related ecosystem tools for Erlang/Elixir developers.
</p>
<p>
By reviewing common development, testing, and deployment problems we
will look at what Nix has to offer to aid Erlang/Elixir developers in
these areas.
</p>
<p>
From seamless developer environment bootstrapping to consistent CI
environments and beyond.

Functional Algebra: Monoids Applied
</h4>
<p>
SCNA 2012 / November 10, 2012 - Chicago, IL
</p>
<h5 id="headline-28">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
In functional programming, words from Category Theory are thrown around, but how useful are they really?
</p>
<p>
This session looks at applications of monoids specifically and how using their algebraic properties offers a solid foundation of reasoning in many types of business domains and reduces developer error as computational context complexity increases.
</p>
<p>
This will provide a tiny peak at Category Theory&#39;s practical uses in software development and modeling. Code examples will be in Haskell and Scala, but monoids could be constructed in almost any language by software craftsmen and women utilizing higher orders of reasoning to their code.

Why Haskell?
</h4>
<p>
Code PaLOUsa 2012 / March 16, 2012 - Louisville, KY
</p>
<h5 id="headline-31">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
Monads, also known as Kleisli triples in Category Theory, are an
(endo-)functor together with two natural transformations, which are
surprisingly useful in pure languages like Haskell, but this talk will
NOT reference monads. Ever. (Well, at least not in this talk.)
</p>
<p>
Instead what I intend to impress upon an audience of newcomers to
Haskell is the wide array of freely available libraries most of which
is liberally licensed open source software, intuitive package
management, practical build tools, reasonable documentation (when you
know how to read it and where to find it), interactive shell (or
REPL), mature compiler, stable runtime, testing tools that will blow
your mind away, and a small but collaborative and knowledgeable
community of developers. Oh, and some special features of Haskell -
the language - too!

Dynamo: Not just for datastores
</h4>
<p>
Strange Loop 2011 / September 19, 2011 - St. Louis, MO
</p>
<h5 id="headline-35">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
Find out how to build decentralized distributed systems based on a
Dynamo-esque philosophy using riak_core, which is used to abstract
away some of the more complicated decentralized and distributed
features of Riak KV, Riak Search and other applications. Assumes some
knowledge of basic Erlang and its concepts of behaviors. The audience
will discover which Dynamo features can be taken advantage of via
<code class="verbatim">riak_core</code> and how to build a simple example.

Distributed Developer Workflows using Git
</h4>
<p>
C-U Developer Meetup / August, 2011 - Urbana, IL
</p>
<h5 id="headline-38">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
This meetup I will be walking the audience through how to setup, configure and maintain distributed development workflows using Git (the distributed VCS developers either love or hate). Much of the workflows suggested here will be applicable to other dVCSes like Mercurial, Darcs and Bazaar.
</p>
<p>
This will be a light, interactive taster of the chapter I am writing for &#34;The Architecture of Open Source Applications, volume 2&#34; that will be coming to an ebook reader or book shelf near you in the Autumn of 2011. Proceeds from book sales go to Amnesty International.

Deploying Distributed Software Services to the Cloud (without Breaking a Sweat)
</h4>
<p>
Code PaLOUsa 2011 / March, 2011 - Louisville, KY
</p>
<h5 id="headline-41">
Abstract
</h5>
<p>
 The promise of cloud computing provides business benefits from reduced costs to increased flexibility. One struggle organizations face as they move to run on cloud infrastructure is automating complex dsitributed deployments.
</p>
<p>
The presenter will discuss issues surrounding the process of automating complex cloud deployments, review tools and techniques that will aid organizations of any size deploy more complex services on distributed nodes, even across a number of cloud infrastructure providers.
</p>
<p>
OpsCode&#39;s Chef, Puppet, Vertibra and in-house solutions found at SaaS (Software as a Service) shops will be compared and contrasted in the talk. The presenter will suggest general solutions and workarounds for potential pitfalls identified for each tool considered.
