      <h1>Principles of economics applied to software development, reliability engineering, and technical leadership</h1>
    </header>

    
<p>
One of my favorite subjects as a lay person is economics from which I have found many
useful applications of core principles relating to my work in software development,
technical leadership as well as my recent reliability engineering roles.
</p>
<p>
This is a post to share some of my thoughts around this.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-1">
A few ideas from economics
</h3>
<p>
The ideas from economics that have resonated with me at work are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
opportunity cost
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Looking at what you lose by choosing a specific activity over
others.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
causal inference with natural experiments
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This uses results from a <em>natural
experiment</em> to answer questions which have enormous potential for distributed
systems (I think).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
comparative advantage
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is not an intuitive idea and typically used in
international trade policy to determine which trading partner would be better
for the bigger dynamic system to be producing even when they aren&#39;t the best
at it globally. This has implications for my work in the best people to assign
work to given other constraints.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
thinking on the margins
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This inspects when marginal costs outweigh marginal
benefit. This has implications for me in my work when scoping, and specifying
infrastructure and system architectures.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
lump of labor fallacy
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A fallacy that is a common misconception in society at
large where people think there is a fixed amount of work so automation or
immigration yields job losses for manual native workers. There are more deeper
insights here too. Implications in operations, &#34;DevOps&#34; culture, etc.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Opportunity Cost
</h3>
<p>
<em>Opportunity cost</em> is the idea that to engage in some activity we are typically making
ourselves or others unavailable to do other activities for that dedicated duration.
</p>
<p>
Paired with the idea of core competencies, which is our distilled understanding of what
makes our company, product, and/or team special, we can pick more strategically which
parts of our application or platform our in-house product team builds versus buys.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Causal inference with natural experiments
</h3>
<p>
To determine causality scientists of all stripes typically design experiments,
collect observations, and then analyze those results derived from the observations.
Today most <em>designed</em> experiments are randomized.
</p>
<p>
However, when it is too expensive to conduct a designed randomized experiment or it&#39;s
difficult to replicate the conditions of the real world another category of experiment
might be used. These are known as <em>natural experiments</em> where recorded observations
from the real world environment can be analyzed in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
Consider in the 90s when New Jersey increased their minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05
per hour. Adjacent Pennsylvania retained its minimum wage at $4.25 (the price before
the increase in New Jersey) so economists surveyed a large number of fast food
restaurants across both states to try to detect whether raising the minimum wage would
negatively impact employment growth this in industry. The <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509">paper</a> can explain its
conclusions better than I can, but the relevant part for our discussion is that
state legislation changed outside of the economists&#39; control; the economists didn&#39;t
setup the conditions of either New Jersey or Pennsylvania so they could run the
experiment, they merely exploited <em>naturally</em> occurring conditions to extract
observations that are meaningful to an interesting question of causality, e.g. in this
case, does raising the minimum wage lead to lower employment growth.
</p>
<p>
As a former software reliability engineer (SRE) I find myself wondering whether and/or
how a change in one part of the system will impact the behavior of the rest, much like
an economist studying factors that might impact employment growth.
