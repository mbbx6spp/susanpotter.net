In Part 2 we will explore our first intuitions about these pairings:
how they are similar to each other
how they are different from each other
how having a common interface for them improves the web developer&amp;#39;s day at work</description></item><item><title>Profunctors for the web developer: Motivating examples, Part 1</title><link>/software/profunctors-for-the-web-developer-motivating-examples-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/software/profunctors-for-the-web-developer-motivating-examples-part-1/</guid><description>Offering examples of profunctors that web developers might find motivating.</description></item><item><title>Parametricity: A Practitioners Guide</title><link>/software/parametricity-a-practitioners-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/software/parametricity-a-practitioners-guide/</guid><description>Introduction What software developer likes surprises, especially in production? Not me. At least not when I am on call. ;)
Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if we were able to reason about our code to make our lives as simple as possible when debugging or eliminate debugging altogether?
The big idea of parametricity is that from parametric (or generic) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; functions we can determine interesting properties (and more of them) from the parametric (generic) types than the equivalent function fixed with specific types.</description></item></channel></rss>
