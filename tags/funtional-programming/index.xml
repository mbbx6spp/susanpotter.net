      <description>Notes:    Originally adapted from a gist in 2018: https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/51bf2b694dc9bbf81b60f2f616453eb3    Moved the original Gist to a snippet.   Goals   This series explores one kind of motivation and building blocks of Profunctors with an aim to introduce the concepts informally while introducing terminology along the way. Motivation   Profunctors are a remarkably practical abstraction for many activities that software developers are concerned with on a day to day basis.</description>

      <description>Originally adapted from a gist: https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/51bf2b694dc9bbf81b60f2f616453eb3 Moved to the original Gist to a snippet.  This is a continuation from part 1.  Profunctors are a remarkably practical abstraction for many activities software developers are concerned with on a day to day basis. Back to basics (Functors)   In one direction (e.g. decoding, deserializing, decrypting, validating) we start with data that needs some transformation yielding new types of data to be used.</description>

      <title>Parametricity: A Practitioners Guide</title>

      <description>Introduction   What software developer likes surprises, especially in production? Not me. At least not when I am on call. ;)  Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if we were able to reason about our code to make our lives as simple as possible when debugging or eliminate debugging altogether?  The big idea of parametricity is that from parametric (or generic) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; functions we can determine interesting properties (and more of them) from the parametric (generic) types than the equivalent function fixed with specific types.</description>
