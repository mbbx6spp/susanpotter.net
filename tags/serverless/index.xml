      <description>Note: After starting to write this blog post series, AWS announced that API Gateway HTTP APIs could now route requests directly to five new services including Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. As a result I adapted the content of this series to account for that, however, it is possible some remnants of prior versions exist in the text.
