Much of the workflows suggested here will be applicable to other dVCSes like Mercurial, Darcs and Bazaar.</description></item><item><title>SCM: The Next Generation</title><link>/software/scm-the-next-generation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/software/scm-the-next-generation/</guid><description>I am sure most developers (whether Java, Ruby, Python, or other) have used Subversion, Perforce or CVS to manage and control their projects&amp;#39; source, but have you used darcs or git?
