      <description>Note: After starting to write this blog post series, AWS announced that API Gateway HTTP APIs could now route requests directly to five new services including Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. As a result I adapted the content of this series to account for that, however, it is possible some remnants of prior versions exist in the text.
 If you notice any such sentences or fragments, please let me know on Twitter (my DMs are open or tweet me publicly).</description>

      <description>On any given day this news discussion site can receive traffic peaks up to five times our base traffic, sometimes requiring us to scale out to double our backend app server capacity within a 10-20 minutes window (sometimes at unpredictable times). In this talk, Susan Potter will discuss DailyKos&amp;#39;s use of autoscaling in EC2 from the essential components to some gotchas learned along the way.</description>
