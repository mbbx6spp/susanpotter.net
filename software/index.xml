      <description>Background   Recently I&amp;#39;ve been reviewing TypeScript code at work. A common pattern I&amp;#39;ve observed in pull requests and some open source projects is a type that looks like the following: type FooTag = &amp;#39;Bar&amp;#39; | &amp;#39;Baz&amp;#39; | &amp;#39;Qux&amp;#39;; type Foo&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; = { _tag : FooTag, /* Required for the &amp;#39;Bar&amp;#39; tagged values of Foo */ bar? : string, /* Required for the &amp;#39;Baz&amp;#39; tagged values of Foo */ baz?</description>

      <description>In 2015 I was binge-reading books on how to break bad habits and create good habits. Since then I have been applying the psychology research I learned from those books to my personal habits and also work habits.  When trying to form habits there are four levers that psychology researchers found made forming habits easier:    easy    obvious    This post will describe just two examples from work the last few years that I designed into my teams delivery processes to encourage developers to deliver work assigned to them as soon as possible without them fearing management was constantly monitoring individual metrics and thresholds as they .</description>

Notes:    all references to $ (dollars) is in reference to US Dollars (USD)    latencies are quoted in milliseconds (ms) unless otherwise noted    this serverless application was deployed using the AWS primitives API Gateway (REST) and AWS Lambda     Last week I deployed my second &amp;#34;serverless app&amp;#34; to production.</description>

      <description>This is an adaptation of a Slack chat explanation from work (slightly reworded to read better for the audience) from work in 2017. Random notes on unikernels  Introducing unikernels   You might have heard terms like unikernel, nanokernel, or library operating systems. These aren&amp;#39;t always used in exactly the same way, but they are highly related terms.  MirageOS is the research project that has received the most industry love of which I am aware.</description>

      <title>DynamoDB: The Basics</title>

      <description>Introduction   This post introduces concepts and principles used to design DynamoDB tables as I have been learning how to leverage this technology in a new project.  This introduction will compare and contrast the core concepts and ideas with those found in relational database management systems (RDBMS). Key takeaways   While using DynamoDB the last couple of months, one of the big takeaways is that data modeling is a vital part and that the modeling process itself looks structurally similar to relational database design.</description>

      <description>Recursive data types   Recursive data structures pop up all over in software from general-purpose structures like lists and binary trees to more application-specific structures like this AST from a simple business rules engine: data BusinessRule input output = IfThenElse (input -&amp;gt; Bool) (BusinessRule input output) (BusinessRule input output) | Return (input -&amp;gt; output) | Stop  Functor  Foldable   The Foldable class gives you the ability to process the elements of a structure one-at-a-time, discarding the shape.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite subjects as a layperson is economics. I have found many useful applications of methods and concepts to my work in software development, technical leadership, and reliability engineering roles.  This is a post to share some of these. A few ideas from economics: an overview   Below is an overview of ideas from economics that have resonated with me at work:   Opportunity cost    Looking at what you lose by choosing a specific activity over others.</description>

      <description>Originally published as a Gist here: https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/60577af8dc4106d6e710cd804292ce20  Minor modifications in formatting and an extra line of no-judgement was added to this text from the original Gist. Purpose, Disclaimer and Confessions   This is the (mostly) no nonesense guide to studies and research that measures and/or compares a variety of facets, characteristics, or manifestations of software development in dynamically vs statically typed programming languages.  Disclaimer: For larger, more complex codebases, I do advocate for statically typed languages that also support algebraic data types, generic types, type classes, and preferrably a form of typelevel expressiveness (e.</description>

      <title>Parametricity: A Practitioners Guide</title>

      <description>Introduction   What software developer likes surprises, especially in production? Not me. At least not when I am on call. ;)  Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if we were able to reason about our code to make our lives as simple as possible when debugging or eliminate debugging altogether?  The big idea of parametricity is that from parametric (or generic) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; functions we can determine interesting properties (and more of them) from the parametric (generic) types than the equivalent function fixed with specific types.</description>

      <description>An algebraic data type can take many forms:    Sum type    Product type    Hybrid Sum/Product type    Recursive type (not covered in this post) Sum Types (aka Tagged Unions)     A sum type is a type that has a known and exhaustive list of constructors where a value of that type must be constructed by exactly one of the constructors.</description>

      <description>I am sure most developers (whether Java, Ruby, Python, or other) have used Subversion, Perforce or CVS to manage and control their projects&amp;#39; source, but have you used darcs or git?  I&amp;#39;m sure most of you would have heard of git it hosts the Linux kernel code currently. Less of you have probably heard of darcs before. Prior to this evening, the most notable point of darcs to me, is that it is written in Haskell.</description>
