Random notes on unikernels
</h3>
<h4 id="headline-2">
Introducing unikernels
</h4>
<p>
You might have heard terms like <em>unikernel</em>, <em>nanokernel</em>, or <em>library operating systems</em>.
These aren&#39;t always used in exactly the same way, but they are highly related terms.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a> is the research project that has received the most industry love of which I
am aware. The research team was acquihired by Docker a few years ago. It is
language-based (they use OCaml), meaning you need to write <em>unikernel</em> applications
in OCaml and it will build an image for various virtualization targets (as well as a
Linux and probably macOS/BSD binary to run on existing OSes for development purposes).
It strips all aspects of the runtime/OS that the application doesn&#39;t need. i.e. if it
doesn&#39;t need the UDP or SCTP stack, then it isn&#39;t shipped in the &#34;library OS&#34; target
binaries reducing your attack surface area. These are one of the awesome things that
excite me about the possibility of the idea of unikernels.
</p>
<p>
Some docs on this are here:
<a href="https://mirage.io/docs/">https://mirage.io/docs/</a>
</p>
<p>
A non-research oriented introduction can be found here: <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/overview-of-mirage">https://mirage.io/wiki/overview-of-mirage</a>
</p>
<p>
Other language-based unikernels include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.includeos.org/">IncludeOS</a> (C/C++)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://galois.com/project/halvm/">HaLVM</a> (Haskell)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
LingVM (Erlang, though it is dead, I think)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have seen unikernels referred to as nanokernels or library operating systems.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-3">
Rump kernels
</h4>
<p>
<em>Rump kernels</em> are either a kind of unikernel or a stepping stone to unikernels
depending on who you talk to. Rump kernels try to work on top of existing
operating systems (OSes) to pare down the build to only what is needed.
These are sometimes termed <em>Just-enough Operating Systems</em> (JeOS) and
what qualifies varies from context to context.
</p>
<p>
The main build-level trade-off compared to unikernels defined above is that rump
kernels leverage existing mature build tooling ecosystems. However, they are often
riddled with legacy decisions that make builds less hermetic or reproducible
(outside of the Nix/Guix worlds), and the resulting artifacts are less slimline as
unikernels by definition thus the comparative attack surface area is still greater
with rump kernels as compared with unikernels though the attack surface area will be
less than a typical system build that runs an equivalent application on a typical
distribution of the same flavor (e.g. Linux, BSD, etc.). A benefit of
rump kernels is the ability to leverage familiar system-level
debugging tooling available compared to unikernels.
</p>
<p>
Rump kernels do allow you to <em>more</em> incrementally migrate your application
from typical OS deployments (where everything including the kitchen-sink is installed
without manual effort to reduce this down) out of the box to more streamlined rump
kernel deployments.
</p>
<p>
The big win with the language-based unikernels (and the hope with the rump unikernels)
is you only ship the code your application uses. Absolutely nothing else, meaning the
compiler target optimizes to an extreme.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Related areas
</h4>
<p>
This is related to another area I am intrigued about as a bystander which is <em>whole
program optimization</em>. Projects like this <a href="https://github.com/mu-chaco/ReWire">whole program optimizer</a> targeting VHDL
from a subset of Haskell is exciting work to me:
<a href="https://github.com/mu-chaco/ReWire">https://github.com/mu-chaco/ReWire</a>
</p>
<p>
Arguably unikernels would could enable more application of whole program optimization
at all levels.
</p>
<p>
We will wait to see what happens in this space.
