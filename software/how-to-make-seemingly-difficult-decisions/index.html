management leadership position in software development knows that you
need to make seemingly difficult decisions frequently.</p><p>This week I coached a coworker through making a difficult decision by
walking through the following process with him. It turned out it
wasn't as difficult as he initially thought.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-1>Process outline</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-3><ol><li><p>Identify your options.</p></li><li><p>List the risks & possible mitigations (for each option).</p></li><li><p>Relatively rank risk ranges and expected risks (across options)</p></li><li><p>List benefits (for each option).</p></li><li><p>Decide and take next steps!</p></li></ol></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>Step 1: Identifying options</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><p>In this step, you need to think creatively. Previously, I have not
always fully explored the option space, which limited my ability to
get more of what I wanted. To inspire creativity, ask questions, talk
to people with different perspectives, take an excursion (walk/cycle/ride),
listen to music you like but haven't listened to in a long time, try
to think of the worst possible option first to get you thinking
differently, or start with the simplest and refine from there.</p><p>Realistically, you want to limit the number of options to about
three to five. So pick the best options and trim down your list after
you have brainstormed.</p><p>Two options is perfectly fine but don't trick yourself into believing
this is the full option space if it still feels like an impossible
decision at step 5. In that case, revisit this step and start over
from here. Hopefully you have time before option opportunity windows
start closing on you due to external factors.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Step 2: List the risks & possible mitigations (per option)</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><p>List out what risks each option has then think about how you can
limit the risks in each case. How likely is it that you can mitigate
the risks in each case? How much control do you really have?</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>Step 3: Relatively rank risk ranges and expected risks (per option)</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>It isn't a quantitative step nor is it objective. In fact, you want
this to be somewhat subjective because you are choosing which problems
and magnitude <em>range</em> of problem <strong>you</strong> would rather recover from when
things don't go your way.</p><p>Here are the parameters to keep in mind as you rank them:</p><ul><li><p>the damage caused by the completely unmitigated option being carried out</p></li><li><p>the damage caused by the perfectly mitigated option being carried out</p></li><li><p>how much control do you have over the mitigations in place?</p></li><li><p>how likely is that that when you take maximum mitigations your
result will be significantly negative.</p></li></ul><p>Remember the purpose isn't to eliminate ALL possible negatives, just
the negatives you really care about. If you only get a +5% return on
investment instead of the outside-chance of +200%, will that ruin
something of import for you or just be less return than completely
unreasonable return on an investment than you thought?
(It might, it might not; it often depends on your operating
environment and relevant factors such as inflation expectations in
this example.)</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-5>Step 4: List benefits (per option)</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-3><p>Remind yourself what the benefits are. Filter out options that have
marginal or unimportant benefits to you.</p><p>If you have exactly one option left then the next step should be easy. :)</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-6>Step 5: Decision and take next steps!</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-3><p>Give yourself a reasonable timebox to do this step given the options
left after step 4. Sometimes you will not have full control of how
long you can take to decide (e.g. job offer deadline) but try to
negotiate if needed to avoid opportunities closing on you.</p><p>At this step, you want to consider if you can negotiate ideal
conditions for exercising your first choice option first before
closing windows that might be good backup options if you can't.</p><p>However, you do not want to hang on this step too long. Make a
considered choice and move on. The Zeigarnik Effect suggests what is
unfinished consumes your working memory which might prolong anxiety or
stress. Take care of yourself. (However, you can use the Zeigarnik
Effect to great effect to help you spur on work momentum, which I
wanted to write about in another post.)</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-7>General notes</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-7 class=outline-text-3><p>This is not for every kind of decision. Some decisions should be
obvious to make given your own values. This is a process generally
needed when upon first look at the problem, all possible solutions
look bad.</p><p>It doesn't work for the times you really need to make a decision in an
instant, however, you might want ask the car salesperson again if that
<strong>once-in-a-lifetime</strong> offer still stands. You might be surprised.</p><p>Your state of mind during this process matters. Try to get your mind
to be calm. Try the methods you know work for you to eliminate anxiety
and stress about making this decision. Try to remember in most cases
you have more control of the situation than you initially thought you would.</p><p>If you are faced with being in the path of a stampeed of woolly
mammoths while hunting for your next meal, this is not the process you
need. Run for your life out of their path!</p><p>Remember that you need to understand you will have imperfect
information. This is increasingly the normal operating environment in
business and technology today.</p><p>One last note about this process is that you don't want to take a long
time on the final step. If that step takes a long time, then maybe you
haven't explored the option space well in step 1. It might save you
time and pain if you revisit step 1 and rethink the possibilities
available to you.</p><p>Hope this helps and remember that you might be able to use this in
other parts of your life too.</p></div></div></main><footer class="flex flex-col bottom-0 left-0 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 body-font w-full mt-8 md:mt-12 lg:mt-16 xl:mt-20"><div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 p-2"><div class="container mx-auto py-4 px-16 flex flex-wrap flex-col sm:flex-row"><p class="text-sm text-center sm:text-left">© 2006 - 2021 Susan Potter —
