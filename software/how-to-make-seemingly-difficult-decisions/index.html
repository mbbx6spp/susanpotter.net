</p>
<p>
Anyone who has spent any time in either a technical or people
management leadership position in software development knows, you need
to make seemingly difficult decisions all the time.
</p>
<p>
This week I coached a coworker through making what seemed like a
difficult decision by coaching him through the following process.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-1">
Process outline
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Identify your options.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
List the risks &amp; possible mitigations (for each option).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Relatively rank the risk ranges (from mitigated to unmitigated, for
each option).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
List benefits (for each option).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Decide and take next steps!
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that steps 1 and 5 act on all the options. Steps 2 through 4
inclusive are per identified option (from step 1).
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Step 1: Identifying options
</h3>
<p>
In this step, you really want to think creatively. There have been
many times I previously didnt fully explore the option space which
limited my ability to get more of what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, you want to limit the number of options to about
3-5. So pick the best 3, 4 or 5 options as you are brainstorming.
</p>
<p>
Two options is perfectly fine but don&#39;t trick yourself into believing
this is the full option space if it still feels like an impossible
decision at step 5. In that case, revisit this step and start over
from here.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Step 2: List the risks &amp; possible mitigations for each option
</h3>
<p>
List our what risks each option has then try to think how could you
limit the risks in each case. How likely is it that you can mitigate
the risks in each case? How much control do you really have?
</p>
<h3 id="headline-4">
Step 3: Relatively rank the risk range (from mitigated to unmitigated)
</h3>
<p>
It isn&#39;t a quantitative step nor is it objective. In fact, you want
this to be somewhat subjective because you are choosing which problems
and the possible problems and <em>range</em> of magnitude <strong>you</strong>&#39;d rather
have.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-5">
Step 4: List benefits for each option
</h3>
<p>
Remind yourself what the benefits are. Filter out options that have
marginal or unimportant benefits to you.
</p>
<p>
If you have exactly one option left then the next step should be easy. :)
</p>
<h3 id="headline-6">
Step 5: Decision and take next steps!
</h3>
<p>
Give yourself a reasonable timebox to do this step given the options
left after step 4. Sometimes you will not have full control of how
long you can take to decide (e.g. job offer deadline) but try to
negotiate if needed to avoid opportunities closing on you.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
General notes
</h3>
<p>
This is not for every kind of decision. Some decisions should be
obvious to make given your own values. This is a process generally
needed when upon first look at the problem, all possible solutions
look bad.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t work for the times you really need to make a decision in an
instant, however, you might want ask the car salesperson again if that
offer might still stand. You might be surprised.
</p>
<p>
Your state of mind during this process matters. Try to get your mind
to be calm. Try the methods you know work for you to eliminate anxiety
and stress about making this decision. Try to remember you might have
more control of the situation than you initially thought you did.
</p>
<p>
If you are faced with being in the path of a stampeed of woolly
mammoths while hunting for your next meal, this is not the process you
need. Run for your life out of their path!
</p>
<p>
One last note about this process is that you don&#39;t want to take a long
time on the final step. If that step takes a long time, then maybe you
haven&#39;t explored the option space well in step 1. It might save you
time and pain if you revisit step 1 and rethink the possibilities
available to you.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps.
