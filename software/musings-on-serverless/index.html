of system infrastructure delivery from hall server closets to
multi-datacenter setups (before what we know as cloud computing was a
thing) all the way to a variety of programmable cloud configurations
across multiple regions and even providers and deploying multi-region
serverless applications in minutes.</p><p>Since the mid-1990s availability has become the coveted prize as
internet and business systems cater to users and business needs 24/7
across the globe.</p><p>As a result, most computing infrastructure at mature organizations
have overhead built-in to enable this availability. Over time, this
overhead leads such companies to paint themselves into corners through
large technology capital investments. Large capital investment leads
to organizations becoming beholden to aging technology so that they
can exploit the balance sheet benefit of amortizing capital
expenditures. Yet this squashes software delivery innovation within
the organization and has opportunity costs.</p><p>Tech startups, on the other hand, churn through many cutting edge
technological changes that don't always work, sometimes at a rate
faster than their engineering team can keep pace with. Many of these
organizations today are leveraging some forms of serverless
today. They have little or no capital investments to ride out and have
a small engineering and operations team compared to their enterprise
counterparts so they prefer to leverage cloud primitives even at a
higher per use cost with the benefit of reducing upfront costs and
scaling to their product's usage which corresponds with their revenue.</p><p>There are a lot of companies in between these extremes and even teams
within larger organizations that are not beholden to enterprise IT.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-1>2007-2014: The rentable programmable <em>"cloud"</em></h3><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-3><p>The first iteration of <em>cloud computing</em> allowed businesses to focus
on their core competencies to deliver products their customers care
about faster for the cost of paying more in your operational costs sooner.</p><p>However, even after developing more maturity than its humble early
beginnings with EC2 instances inside VPCs managed by ASGs that get
attached to load balancers or exposed through cloudfront
distributions so that your applications can scale up dynamically,
<strong>scaling down to zero was always a challenge</strong>.</p><p>Mimicking datacenters via programmable compute and networking
primitives had huge potential for reproducible automation, capacity
planning and (sometimes) operational cost reduction that only some
software companies exploit today. However, it still required a
constant overhead such that scaling to zero was rarely feasible to
accommodate modern availability expectations today. This iteration of
the <em>"cloud"</em> I call the <strong>rentable programmable datacenter</strong>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>2015+: <em>"serverless"</em></h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><p>Serverless is currently allowing those of us at the forefront to
launch new products and services to meet business objectives
experimentally without huge upfront investments in either capital
expenses or engineering time to fully exploit the rentable
programmable datacenter iteration of cloud computing we discussed before.</p><p>Today the prized asset (rightly or not) is <strong>data</strong>. I am not going to
discuss the ways in which this asset is [[corrupting the soul of
democracy]] among other things since this has been well documented.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>What's next?</h3></div></main><footer class="flex flex-col bottom-0 left-0 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 body-font w-full mt-8 md:mt-12 lg:mt-16 xl:mt-20"><div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 p-2"><div class="container mx-auto py-4 px-16 flex flex-wrap flex-col sm:flex-row"><p class="text-sm text-center sm:text-left">© 2006 - 2021 Susan Potter —
