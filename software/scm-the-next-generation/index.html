    <p>
I am sure most developers (whether Java, Ruby, Python, or other) have
used Subversion, Perforce or CVS to manage and control their projects&#39;
source, but have you used <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> or <code class="verbatim">git</code>?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure most of you would have heard of <code class="verbatim">git</code> it hosts the Linux
kernel code currently. Less of you have probably heard of <code class="verbatim">darcs</code>
before. Prior to this evening, the most notable point of <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> to
me, is that it is written in Haskell. Both <code class="verbatim">git</code> and <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> are
examples of distributed version control systems (DVCS) of which there
has been an explosion of products (both commercial and open source)
since <code class="verbatim">GNU&#39;s Arch</code>.
</p>
<p>
Tonight I had the fortune of experiencing <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> for the first
time. Previously I had used <code class="verbatim">darcs get URL</code> to download code before,
but had not utilized any other feature before.  Tonight I submitted a
patch to a Ruby open source project (RForum) and found the experience
very pleasurable as a developer.
</p>
<p>
I have read that <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> is a user friendly version of <code class="verbatim">git</code> minus
some powerful options.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps there are <code class="verbatim">git</code> or <code class="verbatim">darcs</code> gurus reading that can shed more
light on these two less mainstream SCM systems?  If so, I would love
to hear your thoughts on them especially if you can compare and
contrast with any non-trivial Subversion, Perforce or CVS experiences.
</p>
<p>
Background: I currently use Subversion, however, I usually work in
smaller teams, so concurrent work is not that much of an issue at
present, but things will be changing. The largest team I worked in on
a Subversion project was 6 active developers (9 for the one Perforce
project). Previously I worked on a project with over 80 developers,
but that was using <code class="verbatim">ClearCase</code> and there were many problems with that
project that I can&#39;t determine what was caused by <code class="verbatim">ClearCase</code> or the
rest of the project&#39;s many issues.
