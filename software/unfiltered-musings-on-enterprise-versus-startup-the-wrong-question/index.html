of organizations that ranged from the very big and changing slowly to
the very small and growing fast.</p><p>I was asked recently to give advise on the kind of organization a
former colleague should target with their next career move.</p><p>My answer was unenthusiastically received until I elaborated.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from our conversation with some details
edited to protect the innocent. :)</p><hr><p><em>"Enterprise versus startup"</em> is the wrong question to ask.</p><p>Let's start with some definition of terms:</p><dl><dt>startup</dt><dd><p>an earlier stage business which is not yet trading
publicly which may have re</p></dd></dl><p>Tech startups, churn through many cutting edge technological changes
that don't always work, sometimes at a rate faster than their
engineering team can keep pace with. Accruing multiple versions of a
service or capability that need to be maintained in production at the
same time. This is expensive yet this realization is being deferred
due to a combination of factors:</p><ol><li><p>Other investment vehicles aren't providing the alpha that the
wealthy have grown accustom to in recent years. Venture capital
funds are flooded with more cash than they know what to do with.</p></li><li><p>Startups successful at playing the dog and pony show with investors
are now valued much higher and much earlier than before the Dot Com
Crash. The viability of the Internet is no longer in question. This
means the startup can raise large rounds that will carry them much
longer compared to 25 years ago. Ironically, the main reason for these
larger funding rounds is the SEC regulation changes made after the
Dot Com Bust to avoid companies going public too quickly. Today we
are poised to get more WeWorks than WebVans which may prove to be
much uglier.</p></li></ol><p>Given that the enterprise technology world is entrenched in tradition
and slow moving to take advantage of technological innovation and US
startup culture promotes extreme risk-taking by typically younger
founders who do not possess experience-based wisdom it is no wonder
software developers burn out quickly at jobs. It is exhausting working
with antiquated technology when you know more efficient methods and
techniques are already available and mature. Likewise it is exhausting
switching focus every quarter because the board need to see a certain
kind of growth that is lacking at many startups or freshly IPO-ed companies.</p><p>There is a middle ground, however, and that could look like many
things. It might mean taking a job at a smaller growth software
business that is more bootstrapped and less beholden to investor's
growth expectations. It might be a team setup in a large enterprise
that is focused on building products for new business models while
other parts of the organization milk their cashcow legacy products and
services.</p></main><footer class="h-full text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 body-font w-full mt-8 md:mt-12 lg:mt-16 xl:mt-20"><div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 p-2"><div class="container mx-auto py-4 px-16 flex flex-wrap flex-col sm:flex-row"><p class="text-sm text-center sm:text-left">© 2006 - 2021 Susan Potter —
