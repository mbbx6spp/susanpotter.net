<p>
One of my favorite subjects as a layperson is economics. I have found many
useful applications of methods and concepts to my work in software development,
technical leadership, and reliability engineering roles.
</p>
<p>
This is a post to share some of these.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-1">
A few ideas from economics: an overview
</h3>
<p>
Below is an overview of ideas from economics that have resonated with me at work:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Opportunity cost</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Looking at what you lose by choosing a specific activity over
others.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Causal inference with natural experiments</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This uses results from a <em>natural
experiment</em> to answer questions that have enormous potential for distributed
systems.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Comparative advantage</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is not an intuitive idea and
typically used in international trade policy to determine which
trade partner would be better to produce a good even when they
aren&#39;t the best at it globally. This has implications for technical
leadership concerning the best person to assign work to given
other constraints.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Thinking on the margins</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This inspects when the marginal costs
outweigh the marginal benefit. This has implications for me in my work when scoping, and specifying
infrastructure and system architectures.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Lump of labor fallacy</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is a common misconception in society at
large where people think there is a fixed amount of work so automation or
immigration yields job losses for manual native workers. There are deeper
insights here too. This idea has implications in operations, &#34;DevOps&#34; culture, etc.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Applying the ideas
</h3>
<h4 id="headline-3">
Opportunity Cost
</h4>
<p>
<em>Opportunity cost</em> is the idea that to engage in some activity we are
making those tasked unavailable for other activities for the duration
it takes to get the work done.
</p>
<p>
Paired with the idea of core competencies, which is our distilled
understanding of what makes our company, product, and/or team special,
we can strategically pick which parts of our application or platform
our in-house product team builds versus buys.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Causal inference with natural experiments
</h4>
<p>
To determine causality - engineers of all stripes - design experiments,
collect observations and analyze those results derived from the observations.
Today most <em>designed</em> experiments are randomized.
</p>
<p>
However, when it is too expensive to design a randomized
experiment or it&#39;s difficult to replicate the conditions of the real
world, another category of experiment can be used effectively. These
are known as <em>natural experiments</em> where recorded observations from
the real world environment can be analyzed in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
Consider in the 90s, when New Jersey increased their minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05
per hour. Adjacent Pennsylvania retained its minimum wage at $4.25 (the price before
the increase in New Jersey) so economists surveyed a large number of fast-food
restaurants across both states to try to detect whether raising the minimum wage would
negatively impact employment growth this in industry. The <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509">paper</a> can explain its
conclusions better than I can, but the relevant part for our discussion is that
state legislation changed outside of the economists&#39; control; the economists didn&#39;t
set up the conditions of either New Jersey or Pennsylvania so they could run the
experiment, they merely exploited <em>naturally</em> occurring conditions to extract
observations that are meaningful to an interesting question of
causality, e.g. did raising the minimum wage lower employment growth?
Read the paper to find out. :)
</p>
<p>
As a distributed systems engineer who has had to be on-call, I&#39;ve found myself
wondering how a change in one part of the system will impact the
behavior of the rest. This is much like an economist studying
factors that could impact employment growth. When production is being
stressed in a specific way, I find ways to experiment to provide
answers to causality questions. These periods are not as long-lived as
most economic natural experiments, so your infrastructure must allow
for dynamic experimentation. We need to be able
to facilitate experimentation through a variety of tools, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
queryable structured logging
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
good coverage metrics instrumentation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
visualization
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
distributed tracing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
traffic mirroring
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, the crucial element is the mindset of conducting natural
experiments and knowing when it is fine to do this in a production
setting so we can learn more about the real system because often
simulated performance or stress tests are not adequate to depict the
system as it often is stressed in production.
</p>
<p>
A highly related term in reliability engineering is what Netflix calls
<strong>chaos engineering</strong>.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-5">
Comparative advantage
</h4>
<p>
<em>Comparative advantage</em> has to do with choosing trade partners with a
lower relative opportunity cost than other possible trade partners to
produce a good.
</p>
<p>
In technical leadership and engineering management, we can use this
idea when trying to determine the best person to work on a project or
do a task at a specific time.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say that it is the end of July when many developers are on
vacation. We have a need to upgrade an application dependency before
August 15th so that other projects can start which depend on that
being shipped.
In July, we have three developers available but we want to be sure we
are finished before the middle of August. Out of the three developers
available, one developer has had some experience with upgrading
application dependencies, however, this upgrade is a more complex
upgrade than they have handled before. Neither of the other two
developers has worked on this before. A more experienced developer with
direct experience with this scope upgrade complexity is out on
vacation until July 11, leaving only two workdays before July 15th to
work on it. Given the constraints, we should prefer to assign this
work to the mid-level developer because even if the more experienced developer
was capable of upgrading within two days, the opportunity costs of not
meeting our deadline exceed the extra time it would take the
mid-level developer to do the upgrade.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-6">
Thinking on the margins
</h4>
<p>
Sometimes a speedup, cost savings, or optimization of another kind can
cost more than its benefits offer. This is where the thought process
of thinking on the margins helps.
</p>
<p>
In infrastructure engineering, there are many scenarios where we might
be able to take advantage of new technology such as a new cloud provider
resource type, yet because it doesn&#39;t yet support caching or
compression (or whatever) we would then have to implement that in our
application code such that the overall speedup would not give us the
net benefit we sought. In fact, it might yield net negative benefit
when evaluating its use for our specific needs, even if the marketing
blurb by the cloud provider reads very convincingly to the CTO or VP
of Engineering.
</p>
<p>
By thinking on the margin we avoid making the mistake of investing the
time and effort to migrate to this new resource type when the net
benefits do not exist.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-7">
Lump  of labor fallacy
</h4>
<p>
At the advent of DevOps, in the 2000s when the term was coined,
automation was one of the key ideas. In the world of economics, the
general notion of <em>automation</em> is associated with a well-known misconception
known as the &#39;lump of labor fallacy&#39;. The premise of &#39;lump of labor&#39; states
that there is a fixed amount of work available in the economy at large
such that if you were to automate a task you would permanently
eliminate jobs and no new jobs would be created as a byproduct of the automation.
</p>
<p>
In 1891 economist Schloss rebuked the idea that lowering the number of
hours of labor in a workday would see reductions in unemployment and
termed this the &#39;lump of labor fallacy.&#39;
</p>
<p>
Today many economists use the &#39;lump of labor fallacy&#39; to
rebuke the idea that increasing the productivity of existing labor, growing
the labor pool (e.g. via immigration), or increasing automation will
increase unemployment.
</p>
<p>
The original idea of &#39;lump of labor&#39; (not the fallacy) suggests the
economy is a zero-sum game, which most economists do not consider to
be true today.
</p>
<p>
In some countries business leaders and politicians created programs to
offer older workers <em>early retirement</em> with the idea that it would
make &#34;room&#34; for younger workers who had higher unemployment rates. In
reality this was counter productive because it forced a smaller number
of workers to bear the brunt of a pension system that had greater load
and it did not reduce the unemployment levels in younger generations
of workers as much hoped plus took productive and experienced workers
out of the system at the same time.
</p>
<p>
In a Software-as-a-Service engineering organization, you might be able
to make changes to your application codebase such that your developers
can spend less development time on changes, in theory reducing the
time-to-delivery of a new feature. As developers push more changes per
day to production, the underlying infrastructure may demonstrate more
instability in production which requires more manual troubleshooting
and correction from a different team which restricts the number of
available time slots for application developers to push their
changes. This is similar to the early retirement example where the
load has merely be shifted within the overall system which puts more
strain on a part that cannot easily absorb the shock.
</p>
<p>
Also keep in mind as you are able to increase the number of changes
pushed to production per day, someone in your engineering organization
will need to be thinking about how to decrease the latency of the
deploys without increasing the risks too much which is more
automation, i.e. automating yourself out of a job in software
development can only happen when your organization is very badly
managed or the viability of the business is in question.
</p>
<p>
It is worth keeping these dynamics in mind when you are sequencing your
strategic goals such that you ensure load shifts to load-bearing walls.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-8">
Concluding thoughts
</h3>
<p>
Transferring and applying concepts from other disciplines (including
but not limited to economics) has helped me rethink my approaches
in software development, delivery, system design, and management. Hopefully,
this provided enough motivation to read the background on the ideas
you found most interesting or inspired you to borrow from other
disciplines you are familiar with.
</p>
<p>
You could look at safety and reliability engineering disciplines
for SRE applicable ideas from aviation and construction fields as well.

If you might be interested in transitioning your engineering
organization to use better methods and process given your existing
team through my customized team training and interim transformational
leadership services then I would be happy to hear from you <a href="mailto:spotter.at.referentiallabs.com">via email</a>. :)
