      <description>Notes:    Originally adapted from a gist in 2018: https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/51bf2b694dc9bbf81b60f2f616453eb3    Moved the original Gist to a snippet.   Goals   This series explores one kind of motivation and building blocks of Profunctors with an aim to introduce the concepts informally while introducing terminology along the way. Motivation   Profunctors are a remarkably practical abstraction for many activities that software developers are concerned with when building products.</description>

Profunctors are a remarkably practical abstraction for many activities software developers are concerned with on a day to day basis. Back to basics (Functors)   In one direction (e.g. decoding, deserializing, decrypting, validating) we start with data that needs some transformation yielding new types of data to be used.</description>

      <description>Background   Recently I have been reviewing TypeScript code a lot. A common pattern I see repeated in many pull requests and open source projects is a type that looks like the following: type FooTag = &amp;#39;Bar&amp;#39; | &amp;#39;Baz&amp;#39; | &amp;#39;Qux&amp;#39;; type Foo&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; = { _tag : FooTag, /* Required for the &amp;#39;Bar&amp;#39; tagged values of Foo */ bar? : string, /* Required for the &amp;#39;Baz&amp;#39; tagged values of Foo */ baz?</description>

      <description>This is an adaptation of a Slack chat explanation from work (slightly reworded to read better for the audience) from work in 2017. Random notes on unikernels  Introducing unikernels   You might have heard terms like unikernel, nanokernel, or library operating systems. These aren&amp;#39;t always used in exactly the same way, but they are highly related terms.  MirageOS is the research project that has received the most industry love of which I am aware.</description>

      <description>Introduction   This post introduces concepts and principles used to design DynamoDB tables as I have been learning how to leverage this technology in a new project.  This introduction will compare and contrast the core concepts and ideas with those found in relational database management systems (RDBMS). Key takeaways   While using DynamoDB the last couple of months, one of the big takeaways is that data modeling is a vital part and that the modeling process itself looks structurally similar to relational database design.</description>

      <description>Introduction   What software developer likes surprises, especially in production? Not me. At least not when I am on call. ;)  Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if we were able to reason about our code to make our lives as simple as possible when debugging or eliminate debugging altogether?  The big idea of parametricity is that from parametric (or generic) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; functions we can determine interesting properties (and more of them) from the parametric (generic) types than the equivalent function fixed with specific types.</description>

      <description>SCNA 2012 / November 10, 2012 - Chicago, IL Abstract   In functional programming, words from Category Theory are thrown around, but how useful are they really?  This session looks at applications of monoids specifically and how using their algebraic properties offers a solid foundation of reasoning in many types of business domains and reduces developer error as computational context complexity increases.  This will provide a tiny peak at Category Theory&amp;#39;s practical uses in software development and modeling.</description>

      <description>Code PaLOUsa 2012 / March 16, 2012 - Louisville, KY Abstract   Monads, also known as Kleisli triples in Category Theory, are an (endo-)functor together with two natural transformations, which are surprisingly useful in pure languages like Haskell, but this talk will NOT reference monads. Ever. (Well, at least not in this talk.)  Instead what I intend to impress upon an audience of newcomers to Haskell is the wide array of freely available libraries most of which is liberally licensed open source software, intuitive package management, practical build tools, reasonable documentation (when you know how to read it and where to find it), interactive shell (or REPL), mature compiler, stable runtime, testing tools that will blow your mind away, and a small but collaborative and knowledgeable community of developers.</description>

      <description>Strange Loop 2011 / September 19, 2011 - St. Louis, MO Abstract   Find out how to build decentralized distributed systems based on a Dynamo-esque philosophy using riak_core, which is used to abstract away some of the more complicated decentralized and distributed features of Riak KV, Riak Search and other applications. Assumes some knowledge of basic Erlang and its concepts of behaviors. The audience will discover which Dynamo features can be taken advantage of via riak_core and how to build a simple example.</description>

      <description>C-U Developer Meetup / August, 2011 - Urbana, IL Abstract   This meetup I will be walking the audience through how to setup, configure and maintain distributed development workflows using Git (the distributed VCS developers either love or hate). Much of the workflows suggested here will be applicable to other dVCSes like Mercurial, Darcs and Bazaar.  This will be a light, interactive taster of the chapter I am writing for &amp;#34;The Architecture of Open Source Applications, volume 2&amp;#34; that will be coming to an ebook reader or bookshelf near you in the Autumn of 2011.</description>

      <description>This idiom I have seen a little more in Rails than I have seen in Ruby, but I am putting it in this Ruby Idioms series anyway.  First off, most of you will know by know that you can &amp;#34;transparently&amp;#34; provide a method in Ruby a Hash. What do I mean by &amp;#34;transparently&amp;#34;? Well have a look at the code example below: user = User.find(:first, :include =&amp;gt; :preferences)   The last argument is actually a Hash even though you do not see the curly braces at all.</description>

      <description>I am sure most developers (whether Java, Ruby, Python, or other) have used Subversion, Perforce or CVS to manage and control their projects&amp;#39; source, but have you used darcs or git?  I&amp;#39;m sure most of you would have heard of git it hosts the Linux kernel code currently. Less of you have probably heard of darcs before. Prior to this evening, the most notable point of darcs to me, is that it is written in Haskell.</description>

      <description>Tonight I remembered couple more idioms in Ruby and felt compelled to share.  In Javafied Ruby code (below) we often see something like the following: if something for role in user.roles return true if @@roles.include? role end end   Now when I first started writing Ruby code almost 3 years ago, I thought looping through a collection like above was the nicest way. I quickly found Ruby like the following snippet in code I inherited: user.</description>

      <description>Some of you may say this isn&amp;#39;t strictly an idiom, but it is dependent on Ruby&amp;#39;s core API and classes, so I have included it. Ranges are a very nice low-level abstraction and can save Ruby developers a lot of time for certain coding needs. In a previous idiom example on this blog I had a list of positive odd numbers under 7. Well typing this out by hand is hardly consuming so I typed [1, 3, 5] by hand.</description>

      <description>To splat or not to splat, that is the question.  In Java to unpack an array&amp;#39;s values into separate variables you would need to do something like the following: burgers = [:hamburger, :bocaburger, :gardenburger, :turkeyburger] t = burgers[0] u = burgers[1] v = burgers[2] w = burgers[3]   In the Ruby mindset this would look more like the following: burgers = [:hamburger, :bocaburger, :gardenburger, :turkeyburger] t, u, v = *burgers # t=&amp;gt;:hamburger, u=&amp;gt; :bocaburger, v=&amp;gt;:gardenburger t, u, v, w = *burgers # t=&amp;gt;:hamburger, u=&amp;gt;:bocaburger, v=&amp;gt;:gardenburger, w=&amp;gt;:turkeyburger t, u, v, w, x = *burgers # t=&amp;gt;:hamburger, u=&amp;gt;:bocaburger, v=&amp;gt;:gardenburger, w=&amp;gt;:turkeyburger, x=&amp;gt;nil   Think of * (or splat) as the Ruby way of unpacking the elements of an Array into separate variables in Ruby.</description>

      <description>Now, probably the biggest difference after the syntax, and the non-static nature of Ruby for Java heads to get used to is that Ruby is an &amp;#34;expressionist&amp;#34; language. Meaning almost all statements in Ruby evaluates to a value, i.e. everything that reasonably can be is an expression in Ruby is. This is definitely not the way Java thinks or works. So this will take some adjusting to. Don&amp;#39;t worry I will show you an example.</description>

      <description>Now the &amp;#34;idiom&amp;#34; we will use is not specific to Ruby, since I am pretty sure Perl has one of the constructs we will use to solve the stated problem, but it is still idiomatic, since the majority of popular OO languages (static, dynamic or otherwise) do not have it (as far as I know). Also some consider this to be a sub-optimal idiom, because there is a terser way to do something like this.</description>

      <description>With more people moving to Ruby everyday from languages like Java, I wanted to create blog entries on the most common Ruby idioms (especially ones frequently found in Rails core or Rails application code) and briefly explain how to convert your Java mindset to Ruby (over time).  This is the first installment.  First let us inspect what we might do in Java (converted to Ruby syntax) when determining if a value passed in equals various fixed values: if val == 1 || val == 3 || val == 5 puts &amp;#34;hello odd number under 7&amp;#34; end   Rubyists will know this is really ugly, so our first attempt at Rubifying the code above would probably look like: if [1, 3, 5].</description>

      <description>Ever wished you could write code in a very expressive way like the following examples?    expiration_date = 3.years.from_now    birth_date = 32.years.ago    Now you can, in Ruby at least.  Two years ago I was a very happy Python developer that thought no other language could compete with Python for developer productivity. My Python indoctrination occurred after 7 solid years of proclaiming Java was the ultimate language that would reign supreme.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to show the implicit and explicit naming conventions in Ruby for newbies. It isn&amp;#39;t particularly consistent with another language&amp;#39;s conventions, so could cause confusion when reading the Ruby Standard Library (RSL). Where appropriate I also discuss how some of the naming conventions really aid code readability and developer productivity. ClassName and ModuleName [implicit]   Naming classes is very similar to most common conventions following in C++, Java, Python and C#.</description>

      <description>Recently some Java friends of mine have decided to taste the juicier fruits in Ruby-land with my assistance. So below are some excerpts from an email conversation I had with one about Ruby&amp;#39;s standard library forwardable features:  Suppose we have the following model classes defined for a simple CRM system: Customer, Address, PhoneNumber, Name, etc. Now in Java-land we would have written something that looks like the following Ruby code (except you must type about a hundred more lines - although now you can write annotations to automate basic things like generate getters and setters or the like, which still requires a ridiculous amount of code to accomplish): Name = Struct.</description>
