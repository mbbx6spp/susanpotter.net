A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are riding a train through Scotland.
The engineer looks out the window, sees a black sheep, and exclaims, &amp;#34;Hey! They&amp;#39;ve got black sheep in Scotland!&amp;#34;
The physicist looks out the window and corrects the engineer, &amp;#34;Strictly speaking, all we know is that there&amp;#39;s at least one black sheep in Scotland.</description></item></channel></rss>
