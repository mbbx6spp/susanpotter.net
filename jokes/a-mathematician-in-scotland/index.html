      <h1>A Mathematician in Scotland</h1>
    </header>

    
<p>
A passage I came across recently amused me and I wished to share:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are riding a train through Scotland.
</p>
<p>
The engineer looks out the window, sees a black sheep, and exclaims, &#34;<em>Hey! They&#39;ve got black sheep in Scotland!</em>&#34;
</p>
<p>
The physicist looks out the window and corrects the engineer, &#34;<em>Strictly speaking, all we know is that there&#39;s at least one black sheep in Scotland.</em>&#34;
</p>
<p>
The mathematician looks out the window and corrects the physicist, &#34;<em>Strictly speaking, all we know is that is that at least one side of one sheep is black in Scotland.</em>&#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above is a minor adaptation of a joke found in the novel <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>. I adapted it to fit my audience (I know a lot more physicits than logicians nowadays and so-called engineers to economist).
